## Features - Version 1

1. **Safe and Secure**  
The extension doesn't handle your Google Adsense login and thus never needs to know your sign in email or password. It also doesn't store your sign in details anywhere.   

2. **Simple, Effective Design**  
The colours indicate whether your earnings have improved or not. Red indicates a drop in earning, while green indicates an improvement.

3. **Automatic Updates**  
Once you have logged in, Google Adsense Monitor downloads new Adsense earnings data every 15 minutes.

## Note

1. After logging into the Google Adsense control panel, please remeber not to sign out. Just close the tab.

2. After you login, it will take atleast 2 minutes for the data to be updated and displayed in the Speed Dial.
