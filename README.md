**Note**: This version of Google Adsense Monitor is for Opera 12.16 (Presto engine) or below only.  

## Features  

1. **Safe and Secure**  
The extension doesn't need to know your sign in email or password, and doesn't involve itself with the login process. It also doesn't store your sign in details anywhere nor does it share your Adsense data with any other website.

2. **Simple, Effective Design**  
The colour of the earning data indicate whether your earnings have improved or not. Red indicates a drop in earning, while green indicates an improvement.

3. **Automatic Updates**  
Once you have logged in, Google Adsense Monitor downloads new Adsense earnings data every 15 minutes.  

4. **Customisable**  
Change display timings, data update intervals and options to view daily, monthly and / or total unpaid earnings data, as per your preference.   

## Usage

1. After logging into Google Adsense, don't sign out - just close the tab. Please note that it will take at least 2 minutes, after sign in, for the data to be updated and displayed in the Speed Dial.

2. The upward and the downward swing (indicated by the green and red colour, respectively) of the earnings data is based on the comparison with the previous period's earning (i.e. today's earning is compared with yesterday's, and this month's earning is compared with last month's).
